# The Power of Framer Motion

Framer Motion is a powerful animation library for React that makes it easy to create smooth, professional animations.

## Why Framer Motion?

Framer Motion provides a simple API for creating complex animations:

- **Declarative Animations**: Write animations in a React-like way
- **Gesture Support**: Built-in support for drag, hover, and tap
- **Variants**: Reusable animation configurations
- **Layout Animations**: Smooth transitions when layout changes
- **Exit Animations**: Handle component unmounting gracefully

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of using Framer Motion:

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

export default function AnimatedComponent() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
    >
      Hello, Animation!
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

## Advanced Features

Framer Motion also supports:

- **Spring Physics**: Natural-feeling animations
- **Variants**: Reusable animation states
- **AnimatePresence**: Handle mounting/unmounting
- **Custom Hooks**: Like `useScroll` and `useMotionValue`

## Best Practices

When using Framer Motion, remember to:

1. Keep animations subtle and purposeful
2. Use appropriate easing functions
3. Consider performance implications
4. Test on different devices

Happy animating!
