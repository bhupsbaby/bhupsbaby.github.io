# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications. It provides a great developer experience with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several advantages over traditional React applications:

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Better performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation**: Fast page loads and better caching
- **API Routes**: Build backend functionality within your Next.js app
- **File-System Based Routing**: Intuitive and easy to understand
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Including CSS Modules and Sass

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js application, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

## Basic Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-next-app/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── public/
├── components/
└── package.json
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic Next.js application, you can:

1. Create new pages in the `app` directory
2. Add components in the `components` directory
3. Style your application using CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS
4. Deploy your application to platforms like Vercel

Happy coding!
